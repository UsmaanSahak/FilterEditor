Multiple fields, have visitor input values. 
Confirm the values in a preview first.
In preview menu, have it saved into backend.




Array of arrays, where inner arrays are 2 in size. Field and value.
JSON.dumps(OuterArray), and store into backend for now.

First do it in vanilla javascript, and then redo it with REACT.

REACT:
For the FilterForm div, just add to array in order to scalably add more h2+input into the html.


Instead, do two columns


Using javascript:
Click on a transparent input box with a line and a border next to it.
When clicked, have an animation occur where it 'pulses' yellow in reaction before staying highlighted.






Make a transparent yellow rectangle that is hidden and located half way above name, half inside.
Once one thing is clicked, create animation that slides the svg over the selected field and input, highlighting it.


Press submit or press enter;
get an alert, maybe by disappearing this div and having a new div appear with the values, and a new button or enter key to confirm.
